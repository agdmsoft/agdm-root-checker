# Privacy Policy for AGDM Root Checker

**Effective Date:** June 22, 2025

Welcome to AGDM Root Checker ("the App," "we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information the App analyzes, how it is used, and how your privacy is protected. Your privacy is our highest priority. The core principle of the App is that all analysis is performed locally on your device.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App is designed to function with maximum privacy. The data it accesses is categorized as follows:

* **Technical Data Analyzed by the App:** For its primary function, the App analyzes your device's technical configuration, including root status, system properties, bootloader state, SELinux status, and device integrity verdicts via the Google Play Integrity API. This analysis occurs **exclusively on your device**, and the results are shown only to you. We do not collect or store this information on any servers.
* **Data Collected by Third-Party Advertisers (Free Version Only):** The free version of our App may use third-party advertising partners who might collect data to serve ads. This data is collected and managed by them according to their own privacy policies.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

We are committed to your privacy. The App **does not** collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to:

* Your name, email address, or phone number.
* Your contacts, photos, files, or calendar entries.
* Your precise location.

## 3. How We Use Information

The information analyzed by the App is used for the following purposes:

* **To Provide Core Functionality:** To display a comprehensive security report about your device directly to you within the App.
* **To Display Advertisements:** In the Free Version, advertising partners use collected data to serve relevant ads.

## 4. Advertising and User Choice

You can typically control or opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings. On most Android devices, you can do this by navigating to Settings -> Google -> Ads and enabling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" option or resetting your advertising ID.

## 5. Data Storage and Transfer

* **Storage:** All scan results and history are stored **locally** in the App's private directory on your device.
* **Transfer:** We **do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer** any data to third parties. The only exceptions are data collected by our advertising partners as described in Section 4, and data that you explicitly decide to share using the "Export" or "Share" functionality.

## 6. Third-Party Services

In addition to advertising partners, the App uses the **Google Play Integrity API** to assess the device's integrity. This process is governed by the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date."
